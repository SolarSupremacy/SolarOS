# What is sOS (and other Q&A)
sOS is a simulation of a text-based OS written in Lua with the help of LÃ–VE 2D. Other apps can also be loaded, allowing you to develop or download anything you can imagine and run it in sOS!

* Q. Uh... why would anyone make a simulated OS in Lua on another OS? A. Uh... why not?

* Q. What game starting with TIS and ending with 100 inspired you to make this? A. Yes.

# Where do I get apps for sOS?
I will have a webserver up for people to make apps and submit them to be added. Any apps on the official server will be legitimate, apps downloaded from other sources may or may not be up to par.

# How do I develop apps for sOS?
I will create S-Code documentation below once it works.
