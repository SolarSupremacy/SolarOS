# Solar Operating System (sOS)
The ASCII operating system nobody asked for.

# What is sOS (and other Q&A)
sOS is a simulation of a text-based OS written in Lua with the help of LÃ–VE 2D. Other apps can also be loaded, allowing you to develop or download anything you can imagine and run it in sOS!

* Q. Uh... why would anyone make a simulated OS in Lua on another OS? A. Uh... why not?

* Q. What game starting with TIS and ending with 100 inspired you to make this? A. Yes.

# How to run sOS
You need to have LOVE 2D installed to run sOS. If you have ZeroBrane IDE installed, you can open sOS as a project, go to Project > Lua Interpreter and set it to LOVE, then use F6 to execute. Otherwise, drag the *folder* that sOS is in onto 'love.exe'.

# Controls
Escape closes sOS.
Tab switched active windows.
There are not yet controls to move windows around, at least they are automatically centered (you're welcome).

# App Development Documentation
App development uses S-Code, which is just an easier way of saying environment-limited Lua with sOS api. The link for the setup for the sandbox environment is here: https://hastebin.com/acolabiqez.lua You may use any Lua functions included in there, including the api functions at the bottom. This page will be updated as more features are implimented.

# API.G - Graphcis
> api.g.set(x, y, char)

Inputs: 'x' and 'y' are the coordinates for the character, with (1, 1) being the top left. 'char' should be a single character.
Result: 'char' is put onto that coordinate on the canvas to be rendered in the next draw(). Use in draw().
Return: true

> api.g.get(x, y)

Inputs: 'x' and 'y' are the coordinates for the character, with (1, 1) being the top left.
Result: Fetches the char at that coordinate from the last draw(). Use in tick().
Return: string

> api.g.text(x, y, str)

Inputs: 'x' and 'y' are the coordinates for the start of the string, with (1, 1) being the top left. 'str' should be a string of one or more characters.
Result: 'str' is put onto that coordinate on the canvas to be rendered in the next draw(). Use in draw().
Return: true

> api.g.box(x, y, w, h, adapt)

Inputs: 'x' and 'y' are the coordinates for the start of the box, with (1, 1) being the top left. 'w' and 'h' are the width and height of the outside of the box, so the inside is 2 units less on each dimension. 'adapt' is a boolean for if the edges and corners of the box being drawn should automatically reformat to make grids or intersecting lines instead of overwriting the edges of other boxes.
Result: Draws a rectangle out of ASCII characters. Adapt has special effects described above.
Return: true

# API.I - Input
> api.i.keyStat(key)

Inputs: 'key' is a string for the name of the key to be checked. For example, "a", "shift", "space".
Result: Checks to see if the key is being pressed.
Return: true if key is pressed, false otherwise.

# Called Functions
The following functions are called by sOS. This is also the order in which they are called, so code accordingly.

load() - Called once on load. Should contain information about the app.

textInput(char) - Optional. 'char' is a character typed and formatted correctly. For example, if you hold 'shift' and hit 'a', this function will call with the argument 'A'. Useful for easy typing.

keyPress(key, rep) - Optional. 'key' is the name of a key. 'rep' is if the call is because of the key being repeated without releasing it, just like if you hold a key in a chat box and it types one letter, pauses, and then repeats that character. This is defined by your actual operating system and can be ignored by ignoring the call if 'rep' is true.

keyRelease(key) - Optional. 'key' is the name of a key. This function is called if a key is released.

tick() - Called every tick. Still has access to last cycle's canvas, so api.g.get() will still work.

*The canvas is reset after tick() and before draw().*

draw() - Called after every tick. Now is the time to draw things onto the canvas to display.

# App Template and Other Information

This is a template: https://hastebin.com/lukupububu.lua
It doesn't do anything but set up the app.

The app must start with 'local app = {}' and end with 'return (app)'.
All functions must start with 'app.', such as 'app.load()' or 'app.customFunction()'.

Apps must be placed into the /programs/ folder of sOS. They will be automatically loaded and executed.
